# FHIRplace Screenshots

These are some screenshots from FHIRplace, an app I worked on for Zus Health. 

FHIRplace uses React-admin, Material UI 4, and TypeScript alongside with API calls to fetch data.

This picture shows a list view of all the patients (not real data). The list view allows to navigate into specific patients.

Here we can see the 'show' view, which zooms-in on a specific patient. The show view allows for easier access to singular patient (or any other type of resource) data. Some fields, such as the highlighted 'identifier' have a popover with more data that I designed and implemented.

This is a history tab that shows all the related records to a patient. This tab allows to select the related record and contains data about the creation of the patient.
