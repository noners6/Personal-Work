My personal work/projects

**Hello! Welcome to my GitHUb. Here I will put some of my personal projects and group projects I have worked on.**

*Northeatern University:*

NUhabit:
This was a group project for web development project.  It's a small website that helps its users keep track of habits they are trying to form, and awards them with badges after a certain number of days have been successfully completed. The website keeps track of the habits and the badges earned.

My personal website project:
This was a small personal website I developed for a class in Northeastern using JavaScript.

TTM:
In this project, I worked with two other students to develop an interface that helps teams in professional settings communicate their availability status. We have two versions of the interface, one made as a Marvel prototype, and one implemntation with Java. The Marvel prototype more closely resmbled our vision for the interace's design and look.
