# Experiences

**Hello! Welcome to my GitHUb. Here I will put some of my personal projects and group projects I have worked on.**

# Professional Work

*Zus Health:*

At Zus Health, I worked on a visualization for data web-app called FHIRplace that was based on React-admin, MUI, TypeScript/JS. This visualization tool used publicily available data-format called FHIR that is a standard in healthcare, but lacks visualization tools. Throughout my experience in Zus I advanced FHIRplace from being an early-stage development tool that wasn't yet usable, into a customer facing tool that could be sold/exposed to clients. Some of the things I did included transforming JSON files into easily digestable data, using API calls, async methods, designing components and implementing them, and expanding the functionality of the application.

# Personal/School Work 
My personal work/projects

*Northeatern University:*

NUhabit:
This was a group project for web development project.  It's a small website that helps its users keep track of habits they are trying to form, and awards them with badges after a certain number of days have been successfully completed. The website keeps track of the habits and the badges earned.

TTM:
In this project, I worked with two other students to develop an interface that helps teams in professional settings communicate their availability status. We have two versions of the interface, one made as a Marvel prototype, and one implemntation with Java. The Marvel prototype more closely resmbled our vision for the interace's design and look.

Chess simulator:

A chess game between a knight and a rook. This is a spin-off from a class project in Northeastern University. I expanded and built upon a basic chess assignment where we had to create chess pieces. More information is available within the GitHub repo's README
